# mantis-shrimp
This webpage is about mantis shrimp. It contains the most interesting infos about this animal, a picture, a table, and a video too. The video is on an overlay, which will be visible if you click on the video button. It is absolutely responsive (it makes with bootstrap), and if you want, you can use the fullscreen mode, to makes the video more enjoyable. If the video ends, you just click to the "X" button, and the overlay with the video disappears. It has a breakpoint in 768px.

# Built with:
Html5,
CSS,
Bootstrap (But just the video was designed by that. The other elements were fully designed by my own CSS rules.),
javaScript,
jQuery,

I built it in my desktop editor, brackets, and I got font-families from google fonts.
